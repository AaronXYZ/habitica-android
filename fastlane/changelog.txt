In this update, we’ve improved more of our notifications so they bring you to the relevant screen when tapped. When customizing your avatar, you’ll be able to see your avatar updating in real time as you select different options. You can also see your current Gems when gifting Gems from your balance now. We've fixed a few bugs too, including one where tasks wouldn’t load when the app is left running in the background for awhile, and another where Dailies wouldn’t filter properly on launch.
