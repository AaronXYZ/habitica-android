In this update we've cleaned up Guilds and Challenges to look better than ever. Check them out and maybe find something new! Starting or leaving a Quest will update the Party view right away. Snowballs will actually transform your party members now. Certain notifications work better, bringing you to the right place and no longer crashing the app in some cases. Subscriber Mystery Boxes have a fancy new view when opening as well. Check these out and lots of other fixes by downloading the update!
